## Implement pipe()

[pipe()](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pipe-and-compose-in-javascript-5b04004ac937/)

> The concept of pipe is simple — it combines n functions. It’s a pipe flowing left-to-right, calling each function with the output of the last one.

### Question

Implement the `pipe()` method

1. Instead of nesting function calls to use output of one function to input to next function, we'll create a pipeline mechanism.

2. Creating a more understandable and readable code.

### Solution

```javascript
const pipe = (...functions) => (el) => functions.reduce((x, f) => f(x), el);

const double = (x) => x * 2;
const square = (x) => x * x;
const cube = (x) => x ** 3;

const value = pipe(double, cube, square)(2); // output 4096
console.log(value);
```
